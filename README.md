# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with color theme switcher

![Design preview for the REST Countries API with color theme switcher coding challenge](./desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for checking out my solution for this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

The challenge is to integrate the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

Users are able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

## Solution [Live demo](https://countries-react-sass.netlify.app/)

For this solution i've used React and Sass. I've worked on routing, redirecting, data fetching in React and data filtering (filters by parts of the world and filtering with search field).
